# VR Chariots

Will need a basic summary of the project here!

## Project Setup

First, you will need to install Unity 2019.4.20f1 (that's right, 420). Here are some links that will save you valuable seconds of Google searching:
- Download through Unity Hub (Recommended):
    - unityhub://2019.4.20f1/6dd1c08eedfa
- Download directly as Windows Installer:
    - [Download](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download?thank-you=update&download_nid=64467&os=Win)
- Download directly as MacOS Installer:
    - [Download](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download?thank-you=update&download_nid=64467&os=Mac)

From there, clone this repository onto your machine and open the respective directory as a project in Unity (if you are using UnityHub, ensure the correct version of Unity is being used to open the project). This will be all that's necessary to begin contributing to the project, however there are additional steps to build the project; see the "Build" section below.
